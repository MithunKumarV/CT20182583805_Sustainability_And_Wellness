             In this problem we have given wearable devices that are incorporated with human to supervise health related problems such as blood pressure, sugar level, etc. Wearable computing help in health monitoring of patient.  And weâ€™ve also used WBAN (wireless body area network) technology.

1) Created a Web interface.
2) Created a Mobile interface.
3) I have created prediction model to check accuracy of the employee health.

Conclusion:
            The data is acquired as the common gateway using web portal than transferred to the web service on cloud the analysis based on machine learning algorithm was done on cloud to predict the health content to employee on the basis of daily activities.  We have shown the integration of Wireless Body Area Network with the Internet of Things using the PHP based Front End and MySql as Backend of a network of wearable sensors.
